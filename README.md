# Azure Hybrid Identity Lab
A hands on laboratory demonstrating the synchronization of an On-Premise Active Directory environment with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) using Azure AD Connect.


# ☁️ Azure Hybrid Identity Lab: On-Prem to Cloud Sync

## 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Hybrid Identity** infrastructure by synchronizing an on-premises Active Directory environment with **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**. This lab simulates a corporate migration to the cloud, allowing for centralized management of users and resources across both local and cloud environments.

## 🔗 The Evolution of the Lab
This project is a direct sequel to my **[On-Premise Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/techboulnp-gif/Active-Directory-Home-Lab)**. 
* **The Foundation:** In the previous lab, I built a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller and automated the creation of **5,000+ enterprise user accounts** using PowerShell.
* **The Goal:** In this phase, I am bridging those 5,000 local identities to the cloud using **Azure AD Connect**, enabling features like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Microsoft 365 integration.
